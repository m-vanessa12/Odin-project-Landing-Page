# Odin-project-Landing-Page

In The landing page, I designed it using the idea that I had in mind of mental health website but I FOLLOWED THE DESIGN SAMPLE WE HAD.
In this project, I have learned different CSS skills and improved hmtl one. I also faced different struggles like knowing if I had to use 
display or margin But i tried to overcome the challenges for me to complete the challenge even if it took me more time plus made me delay
the submission time.
